# JsMinSharp

This is an updated version of JSMin for c#. There's been countelss versions of the original JSMin ported to c# but from all of the ones I've seen, they have not been updated to deal with some of the minification issues that have been reported to me on a couple of my projects.

This repository is therefore my attempt at keeping an updated version of JSMin with bug fixes for c#. I've updated some variable and method names and included code comments to make it easier to understand. I've also ported over the issues from my other projects to this project to track the various issues resolved.
